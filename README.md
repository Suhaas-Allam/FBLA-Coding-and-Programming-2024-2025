// What is this project?

Hello! Our names are Suhaas Allam and Smaran Beereddy, and this project is a submission for the
Coding + Programming Event in FBLA. This project is composed of multiple parts
which will be explained below, but there are also comments within the code itself
to help you understand its purpose. This code allows the user to implement multiple pieces
of data into our program, such as transactions, the total balance, and spending, and our program can also
generate summaries of such information.

// My Code in Java

I coded this using Java, meaning to run this program, you will need to install
Java and a Java code runner such as IntelliJ.

// How to run this using IntelliJ (Recommended Code Runner)

Because this program is coded in Java, you will need to install an IDE that runs Java code, such as
IntelliJ, and when you install this IDE and want to use our program, you will have to import the file
